## node-unifi class usage examples

This directory contains some javascript code examples which demonstrate usage of the node-unifi class and can be used as a good starting point for your own custom code.

### Usage

You can either copy the examples files here to your own working directory, edit and run them. All you have to modify is the `import Unifi from '../unifi.js'` statement, which should be changed to `import Unifi from 'node-unifi'` once node-unifi has been globally installed. Or you run these examples directly in here.

#### Executing scripts from the command-line

Most of the included example scripts can be run from a command shell:


```sh
$ ./first-steps.js <IP> <PORT> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
```

Just replace all `<...>` identifiers with the proper parameters so that the script can directly communicate with the selected UniFi controller.

### Contribute

Use these examples at your own risk!
